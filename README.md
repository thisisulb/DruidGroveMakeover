Introduction

This mod aims to improve
the visual esthetic of the druid grove outdoor area.

When I first went to the
druid grove area I was expecting a magical forest, full of life and
thematically fitting. What I found was a barren, sickly and dead
swamp area. The exterior of the druid grove itself was even more of a
disappointment. It looks more like a bomb shelter build from concrete
or a chemical plant than a mystical druid grove.

With this mod I aim to fix
that by overwriting the area art with a modified version.


2. Overview

Changes only affect the
area art, everything else (lighting, pathing, triggers, ..) stays
exactly the same. The mod focuses mostly on the upper (northern) part
of the map 

(the area you reach after
passing the abandoned house and crossing the second bridge) and
especially on the druid grove exterior itself. This part of the map
has been re-designed to resemble a more traditional (slightly higher
altitude) forest with some trees and grass covered ground. 

The lower part of the map
has had some vegetation patterns added to the ground to cover up the
barren orange dirt and make it look more alive.

by side comparison between the old and new druid grove exterior at

3. Compatibility

The mod
should be fully compatible with pretty much every mod out there that
does NOT change the area art and is compatible with the
classic BG2/ToB game as well as BG2EE (and EET).

The only mod
I can think of that will probably cause compatibility issues is the
BG Graphics Overhaul mod. Assuming the mod does not alter the .wed
files or add the extended night flag to the area, installing my mod
AFTER BG Graphics Overhaul should simply overwrite any changes
that it might have made to the druid grove area.


4. Installation

I. Extract the
'DruidGroveMakeover.7z' file into your main game folder and make sure
that both, the 'Setup-DruidGroveMakeover .exe' and the
'DruidGroveMakeover' folder, are indeed in your main folder.

II. Run (double click on)
"Setup-DruidGroveMakeover .exe".
